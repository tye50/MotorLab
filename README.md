## Challenges:

### 1: Drive forwards
No limits on how long or how far, just get your romi to drive straight!

Use `void driveForwards(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.

### 2: Drive backwards
Just like the last command, but backwards.

Use `void driveBackwards(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.

### 3: Turn in place
Make your romi turn clockwise in place. You'll need to think about this one!

Use `void turnRight(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.

### 4: Turn left
Make your romi turn counter-clockwise in place.

Use `void turnLeft(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.

### 5: Arcing left and right
Instead of turning in place or moving straight, try to get your romi to move forward while turning.

Use `void arcRight(Motor left, Motor right) {}` and `void arcLeft(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.

### 6: Stopping
Until this point, all of our commands have run without end, probably with some bad consequences. Let's make our romi stop after travelling 1 meter forwards.

Use `void stopOneMeter(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.

### 7: Bang bang
Although our romi does stop, you might have noticed that it overshoots our target a little bit. Lets say that we really need our romi to be on target. How about we make the romi move back if it overshot?

Use `void bangBang(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.

### 8: Better control
We saw in the last command that, although Bang-bang does bring the romi back to the target, it also has a lot of oscillation. How can we try and fix this? Can we make the romi's speed depend on how far it is from the target?

Use `void betterBangBang(Motor left, Motor right) {}`.
